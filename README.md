## Project Architecture üèóÔ∏è
### Overview  
The LAKAYA platform is architected to seamlessly connect fishermen and investors through a highly interactive, scalable, and intuitive web application. It incorporates modern technologies and algorithms to ensure a robust and user-centric experience.

### **Frontend (User Interface)**  
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Purpose**: Builds a responsive, intuitive UI for diverse devices.  
- **Pages**:
  - Homepage
  - Investment Page
  - Be a Fisherman Page
  - Fisherman and Investor Profiles
  - Login and Register Page
- **Integration**:
  - **Map-Based Filtering**: Location search using the Haversine formula.
  - **Budget-Based Filtering**: Algorithmically ranks fishermen (Knapsack algorithm).

### **Backend (Business Logic)**  
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js  
- **Purpose**: Provides RESTful APIs for communication.  
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Authentication**: JWT-based login/registration.
  - **CRUD Operations**:
    - Create and manage fishermen profiles.
    - Manage investments and bookings.
  - **Algorithms**:
    - Knapsack algorithm for budget optimization.
    - Haversine formula for location-based search.

### **Database**  
- **Technology**: Firebase - Firestore
- **Purpose**: Stores structured data for:
  - User profiles
  - Fisherman information (name, location, fishing method, capacity, fish type, etc.)
  - Investment and booking records.

### **Integration Features**  
- **Map Services**: Integrated via third-party APIs for geolocation-based searches.  
- **Email Notifications**: Confirmations for bookings and investments.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Analytics for user growth and sustainable impact.

### **Algorithms**  
- **Haversine Formula**: Calculates the shortest distance to fishermen based on user location.  
- **Knapsack Algorithm**: Matches fishermen to investors by maximizing sustainable impact under budget constraints.
